# Cranfield
The Cranfield collection was the pioneering test collection in allowing precise quantitative measures of information retrieval effectiveness. Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries, and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs.
